Hi! My name is Chirayu Salgarkar, and I am an incoming graduate student in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at The Rochester Institute of Technology, supervised by Dr. Ali Baheri. I graduated from Mercer University in 2024, where I studied biomedical engineering and mathematics as a Stamps Scholar.

At Mercer, I was a research assistant at the Dynamical Systems and Control Laboratory, where I worked on problems in safety-critical control. Previously, I have worked in full-stack development roles at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, as a prosthetic fitter in Cambodia, and as a research assistant at Georgia Tech's LIDAR Lab, where I worked on bipedal robot communication. I am an alumnus of the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics.

Academically, I am currently interested in how mathematical theory can be used to guarantee safety for highly nonlinear systems, especially autonomous systems. More broadly, I am interested in leveraging my technical skills in projects with high potential for positive social impact.
